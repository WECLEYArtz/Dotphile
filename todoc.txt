 version 0.99 of a script to move and symlink anything in the home directory

==== steps ============================

the script takes file or directory path (incase of adding) 
or file/directory name (incase of redo and undo)
after an action parameter (-a -r -u).

Adding a file / directory :

	must take path

	if a path is given, it checks the existence of the file/directory, (error  if
	it exists in the current directory), then the target gets moved to dotfile
	and symlinked to the old location where it was moved from.

	if ./name is given to add, it has to exit,
	broken link at the end of the line.
	it will verifies that by checking the current directory (has to be the dotfile one),
	once the file is found, it exit returning 5, adding should only be done
	from outside the dotfile directory.

	once the move and symlink are done, archive.txt gets updated with the current
	and old location of the doted file.

	no overwrite protection is needed here, once file is moved the name is no longer taken
	to be used by symlink.


Redoing a file / directory :

	must take existing ./name

	if ./name is given, and exists, it greps the current and old locations
	saved in archive.txt and refeed them to the symlink function.

	protects overwrite

	if ./name exists, and archive.txt isnt well synced, bad grep returnd
	with exit with 1.

	if ./name doesnt exists, exiting with 2

Undoing a file / directory :

	must take existing ./name

	if ./name is given, and exists, it greps the current and old locations
	saved in archive.txt, safely remoce the link or anything in it location
	and move the file back where it used to be.

	if ./name exists, and archive.txt isnt well synced, bad grep returnd
	with exit with 1.

	if ./name doesnt exists, exiting with 2

	protects overwrite

==== archive.txt ============================

	[ FILE_NAME ]
	target=	'DOTFILE_PATH/TOSYM_NAME'
	smlink=	'TOSYM_PATH'

	NEXT:
	[ FILE_NAME ]
	target=	'DOTFILE_PATH/TOSYM_NAME'
	smlink_1=	'TOSYM_PATH_1'
	smlink_2=	'TOSYM_PATH_2'
	smlink_3=	'TOSYM_PATH_3'
	smlink_4=	'TOSYM_PATH_4'
	smlink_5=	'TOSYM_PATH_5'

=============================================

heck its sef explanatory, aint typing allat.

TODO:

- fix error handling and messages

- ability to resymlink to passed argunment, prioritized, then archive.

- scarpped (check env var for dotfile path, incase of quick reinstall)

- verify the path line in archive incase

- list files from archive

- multiple files operating *-*
	ability to link to multiple directories,
	give a file archive multiple paths?
	 
- clean archive from unexisting files

-history of returned/undone files
